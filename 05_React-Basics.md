## Course syllabus for React Basics
By the end of this reading, you will have learned about the scope of things you will cover in this course. 

### Prerequisites
To take this course, you should understand the basics of ```HTML```, ```CSS```, and ```JavaScript```. Additionally, it always helps to have a can-do attitude!

### Course content
This course is an introduction to **React development**. You'll learn enough basic concepts to empower you to build simple user interfaces in React.

This course consists of **four modules**. They cover the following topics.



### Module 1: Anatomy of React
In this introductory module, you'll learn about what React is and where it is used. You'll also learn how to set up your coding environment so that you have as productive a learning experience as possible. So, the purpose of this module is to understand the what and the why, and to get set up for the modules that follow.

Components are one of the foundations of React. In React, everything revolves around components. You'll learn how to build components, how to structure and customize your React projects, and how to compose layouts by importing components into other components.

You'll learn about passing data from one component to another. You'll learn about JSX syntax in React and how to use it to structure and style your components.

By the end of this module you will be able to:
- Explain the concepts behind React and component architecture.
- Describe how to use assets within an app to apply styling and functional components.
- Create a component to service a specific purpose.
- Create a folder and demonstrate how to create and import files within that folder.
- Use and manipulate props and components to effect visual results.



### Module 2: Data and State
The second module of this course deals with working with events and errors in React. You'll learn how events work and how you can handle them in React. Handling events can sometimes get a bit tricky, so you'll also learn about dealing with errors related to events in React.

By the end of this module you will be able to:
- Use common methods to manage state in React.
- Detail the concept and nature of state and state change.
- Describe the hierarchical flow of data in React.
- Describe how data flows in both stateful and stateless components.
- Use an event to dynamically change content on a web page.
- Describe some common errors associated with events and the syntax required to handle them.



### Module 3: Navigation Updating and Assets in React
In this module, you'll learn about routing and navigation in React. You'll learn how to render partial views and how to update routes in your React apps. You'll understand how assets are used, bundled and embedded.

By the end of this module you will be able to:
- Use media assets, such as audio and video, with React.
- Demonstrate how to manipulate image assets using reference paths.
- Explain the folder structure of a React project in terms of embedded or referenced assets.
- Demonstrate the conditional implementation and rendering of multiple components.
- Create and implement a route in the form of a navbar.
- Describe navigation design in React, with a focus on single and multi-page navigation.



### Module 4: Portfolio Mini-Project (Calculator App)

This module is focused on a practical mini project of building a calculator app in React. Upon completing this module, you'll have coded your own mini project in React, as a starting point for building your React portfolio.

You have now learned about the scope of things you will cover in this course.

By the end of this module you will be able to:
- Synthesize the skills from this course to create and style a React component.
- Reflect on this course's content and on the learning path that lies ahead.






## How to be successful in this course
Taking an online course can be overwhelming. How do you learn at your own pace and successfully achieve your goals? 

Here are some general tips that can help you stay focused and on track.



### Set daily goals for studying 
Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish in your course each day. Setting a clear goal can help you stay motivated and beat procrastination. The goal should be specific and easy to measure, such as "I’ll watch all the videos in Module 2 and complete the first programming assignment". And don’t forget to reward yourself when you make progress towards your goal! 



### Create a dedicated study space 
It’s easier to recall information if you’re in the same place where you first learned it, so having a dedicated space at home to take online courses can make your learning more effective. Remove any distractions from the space and if possible, make it separate from your bed or sofa. A clear distinction between where you study and where you take breaks can help you focus.  



### Schedule time to study on your calendar 
Open your calendar and choose a predictable, reliable time that you can dedicate to watching lectures and completing assignments. This helps ensure that your courses won’t become the last thing on your to-do list. 

_**Tip:** You can add deadlines for a Coursera course to your Google calendar, Apple calendar, or another calendar app._



### Keep yourself accountable 
Tell your friends about the courses you’re taking, post achievements to your social media accounts or blog about your homework assignments. Having a community and support network of friends and family to cheer you on makes a difference!



### Actively take notes 
Taking notes can promote active thinking, boost comprehension and extend your attention span. It’s a good strategy to internalize knowledge whether you’re learning online or in the classroom. So, grab a notebook or find a digital app that works best for you and start synthesizing key points. 

Tip: While watching a lecture on Coursera, you can click the 'Save Note' button below the video to save a screenshot to your course notes and add your own comments.



### Join the discussion 
Course discussion forums are a great place to ask questions about assignments, discuss topics, share resources and make friends. Our research shows that learners who participate in the discussion forums are 37% more likely to complete a course. So make a post today! 



### Do one thing at a time 
Multitasking is less productive than focusing on a single task at a time. Researchers from Stanford University found that “People who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.” Stay focused on one thing at a time. You’ll absorb more information and complete assignments with greater productivity and ease than if you were trying to do many things at once.  



### Take breaks 
Resting your brain after learning is critical to high performance. If you find yourself working on a challenging problem without much progress for an hour, take a break. Walking outside, taking a shower or talking with a friend can help you to re-energize and even give you new ideas on how to tackle the project. 



### Your learning journey starts now!  
While preparing for the module quiz or working on achieving your learning goals you're encouraged to:   
- Work through each lesson in the learning pathway. Try not to skip any activities or lessons unless you are certain that you already know this information well enough to move ahead.    
- Take the opportunity to go back and watch a video or read all the information provided before moving on to the next lesson or module.  
- Complete all the knowledge and module quizzes and exercises.
- Read the feedback carefully when answering quizzes, as this will help you to reinforce what you are learning.  
- Make use of the practical learning environment provided by the exercises. You can gain substantial reinforcement of your learning through the step-by-step application of your skills.









# MODULE 01 - React Components



## Before you learn React
Do you know the fundamentals of ```HTML```, ```CSS``` and ```JavaScript```? Perhaps you learned about these technologies from another course. Either way, a quick summary will be useful so let's explore some fundamental ```HTML```, ```CSS``` and ```JavaScript``` **principles** and **practices**.

In this reading, let’s take a practical approach, and revisit some of the development techniques you'll need to be comfortable with before learning React.

To get the most out of this course on React basics, you should first understand the fundamental methods and concepts of ```JavaScript```. Otherwise, you may feel like you’re a child learning to run before you can walk. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React apps are built using modern JavaScript features, which are commonly known as ES6. Developers use React to develop **Single Page Applications**. And you can also develop mobile applications with React Native.

As an aspiring developer, you may opt for a ‘learn as you go approach’ regarding JavaScript and React. But this may not help your productivity and even at times frustrate you. This is because you may confuse code or functionality that is plain JavaScript, or code that is React.

For example, with a solid foundational knowledge of JavaScript, you can quickly identify code that is JavaScript ES6 and code that is React. And throughout this course, there will be help for you along the way with some friendly reminders. 

Also, keep in mind that you are using **React** to build user interfaces which **also include HTML and CSS code**.

So let’s begin with the fundamental HTML knowledge needed to learn React.



### HTML
Recall that ```HTML``` is used to describe the **structure of Web pages**. Developers use ```HTML``` elements with their opening and closing tags to “mark up” an HTML document. 

These elements form the structure of a web page and describe what to display to the web browser. When it comes to HTML it's important to know about:
1. The purpose of HTML in the web browser,
2. the use of HTML tags and correct syntax,
3. and how HTML elements are used in a web document. 

Another important concept to know about when you're talking about HTML is the **Document Object Model, or DOM**. 

Users need to be able to interact with elements on a web page. This means that an HTML document must be represented in a way that JavaScript code can query and update it. And that's the function of the DOM. It's a model of the objects in your HTML file.

And web developers interact with the **DOM** through ```JavaScript``` to update content, set up events and animate HTML elements.

Before you learn React, it’s advisable that you are comfortable with the following HTML tags and concepts

#### Layout & Style
- ```<html>``` 
- ```<head>``` 
- ```<body>``` 
- ```<div>``` 

#### Text formatting & lists
- ```<h1>…<h6>``` 
- ```<p>``` 
- ```<ul><li>``` 
- ```<b><i>``` 

#### Images and links
- ```<img src="">``` 
- ```<a href="">```

#### Linking and Meta
- ```<link>``` 
- ```<title>``` 
- ```<meta>``` 

#### Semantic
- ```<header>``` 



### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that you use to style ```HTML```. You need to be familiar with basic CSS concepts before you start learning React. This is because you will need to style your React components as well, and basic CSS knowledge will help your learning journey.

Before you learn **React**, make sure you are comfortable with these CSS styling options:
- Font styling (font size, font color, etc.) 
- Flex Box Layout (Layout of items using CSS Flex Box Layout) 
- CSS Selectors 
- Position, Padding, Margins and Display 
- Colors, Background and Icons 

You can refresh your knowledge of HTML and CSS in the Meta course titled: [Introduction to Front-End Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-front-end-development)



### JavaScript fundamentals and ES6
React is completely written in JavaScript and uses the more modern version of JavaScript which is ES6. While learning React, you should already know JavaScript fundamentals. 

**JavaScript** is the programming language and **React** is a ```JavaScript UI library```. This means the **first step is to be proficient at JavaScript**.

Here are some of the JavaScript topics that you need to be comfortable with before you begin your journey learning React.
- Data types 
- Using var, let and const 
- Conditionals and Loops 
- Using objects, arrays and functions 
- ES6 Arrow functions 
- In-built functions such as map(), forEach() and promises. 
- Destructuring Arrays and Objects 
- Error Handling 



### Package Manager (Node + npm)
**React** is a ```UI library```, and you will encounter that many times you will need to add other packages to your React application. A package in ```JavaScript``` contains all the files needed for a module. To install these packages effectively and manage their dependencies you can use a package manager like **NPM (Node Package Manager)**.

You can install **npm** by installing ```Node.js```, which will then automatically install npm.

You need to be comfortable with using **npm** as your package manager, since you will be using **npm to install packages within your React application**.  Make sure you are aware of how to do the following with npm before you get started on this course.
- Installation command to install npm modules in your project 
- Installing a package as a dev dependency 
- Start command 
- Updating npm version 
- Navigating around the package.json file 

Once you have become confident with these skills, you’ll be in a better position to learn and apply React concepts and prepare yourself for development of React apps.

## Transpiling JSX
By the end of this reading, you will have learned how a component is built.
Introduction
Components are a nice way to build websites in React because they allow you to build more modular apps. However, how do you build components using React, JSX, and JavaScript? You'll learn how this works in this lesson item.

A browser cannot understand JSX syntax.
This means that making a browser understand React code requires a lot of supporting technologies.

An example of such a technology is a transpiler.

A transpiler takes a piece of code and transforms it into some other code.

To understand why this is done, here is an example of an ES6 variable declaration:

1
const PI = 3.14
This is perfectly valid ES6 syntax.

However, if you were using a very old computer, that computer will have an old browser. Perhaps that browser was built before ES6 came out in 2015.

This means that the JavaScript engine that is built into your old computer's browser is likely to be an ES5 JavaScript engine.

In ES5, the only way to declare a variable is the following:

1
var pi = 3.14
What this means is that for this old browser to understand the ES6 code, the only way to do it is by transpiling it.

This means you need a way of essentially translating the modern js code into a format that an older js engine can understand.

Let's say that you want to use a brand new, most modern ECMAScript syntax in an app. The only problem is that this new syntax is currently not supported by any browser; even an up-to-date browser.

However, by transpiling the new most-modern JavaScript syntax into something that modern browsers can understand, it is able to convert some code that the browser cannot comprehend, into code that it can comprehend, run, and produce a result from.

Likely the most popular site that shows off how this works is 
Babel
. As the heading of the website reads, "Babel is a JavaScript Compiler".

This finally brings you to the point of this discussion about transpiling JavaScript code.

What Babel does is this: it allows you to transpile JSX code (which cannot be understood by a browser) into plain JavaScript code (which can be understood by a browser).

This is where React and JSX come in.

For React code to be understood by a browser, you need to have a transpiling step in which the JSX code gets converted to plain JavaScript code that a modern browser can work with.

To demonstrate how this works, let’s use the Heading component from the previous lesson.

Add the JSX code into 
the online Babel repl
. Repl stands for "read-eval-print loop" and it accepts code you write, evaluates it, and produces some result. In the specific case of 
the online Babel repl
, that result is some transpiled code. Here's a more detailed explanation.

If you've visited the above-linked URL, you'll find a web page that has two panels. On the left, there's source JSX code:

123
function Heading(props) {
    return <h1>{props.title}</h1>
}
... and on the right, there's the transpiled, plain JavaScript code. However, ensure that you select the classic runtime for React in the left sidebar.

3
function Heading(props) {
  return /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("h1", null, props.title);
}
If you now analyze the difference between the source JSX code and the transpiled, plain JavaScript code, dis-regarding the comment, here's the body of the Heading function:

12
React.createElement("h1", null, props.title);

So, here you have a React object, and this object has a createElement() method on it. The method is invoked with three arguments:

"h1" 

null 

props.title 

The first argument is the DOM element to render - in this case, an h1 element. The second property is any HTML attribute that should be added, and there's a null here - meaning, there should be an object with some data, but there isn't any data so instead of the object there's the null value. The third property is the contents of the inner HTML of the DOM element specified as the first argument - in this case, the contents of the inner HTML of the h1 element.

Now let’s use Babel again, and this time transpile the render syntax for the Heading component:

1
<Heading title="This is the heading text!"></Heading>
Again using 
the Babel repl
, and as can be confirmed in 
the link
, the output of the tranpilation is the following code. Ensure that you select the classic runtime for React in the left sidebar.

1234
/*#__PURE__*/
React.createElement(Heading, {
  title: "This is the heading text!"
});
Again, you have the React.createElement() method call, and this time, the first item to render is Heading, and then you have an object as the second argument (instead of a null that you had in the previous transpilation example).

This brings me to an interesting question: What is the minimum code that a component must have to be able to show something on the screen when rendered?

You can see the answer below:

1234
function Example() {
    return <div>An element</div>
}
export default Example
