## How to be successful in this course
Taking an online course can be overwhelming. How do you learn at your own pace and successfully achieve your goals? 

Here are some general tips that can help you stay focused and on track.

### Set daily goals for studying 
Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish in your course each day. Setting a clear goal can help you stay motivated and beat procrastination. The goal should be specific and easy to measure, such as "I’ll watch all the videos in Module 2 and complete the first programming assignment". And don’t forget to reward yourself when you make progress towards your goal! 

### Create a dedicated study space 
It’s easier to recall information if you’re in the same place where you first learned it, so having a dedicated space at home to take online courses can make your learning more effective. Remove any distractions from the space and if possible, make it separate from your bed or sofa. A clear distinction between where you study and where you take breaks can help you focus.  

### Schedule time to study on your calendar 
Open your calendar and choose a predictable, reliable time that you can dedicate to watching lectures and completing assignments. This helps ensure that your courses won’t become the last thing on your to-do list. 

_**Tip:** You can add deadlines for a Coursera course to your Google calendar, Apple calendar, or another calendar app._

### Keep yourself accountable 
Tell your friends about the courses you’re taking, post achievements to your social media accounts or blog about your homework assignments. Having a community and support network of friends and family to cheer you on makes a difference!

### Actively take notes 
Taking notes can promote active thinking, boost comprehension and extend your attention span. It’s a good strategy to internalize knowledge whether you’re learning online or in the classroom. So, grab a notebook or find a digital app that works best for you and start synthesizing key points. 

_**Tip:** While watching a lecture on Coursera, you can click the 'Save Note' button below the video to save a screenshot to your course notes and add your own comments._

### Join the discussion 
Course discussion forums are a great place to ask questions about assignments, discuss topics, share resources and make friends. Our research shows that learners who participate in the discussion forums are 37% more likely to complete a course. So make a post today! 

### Do one thing at a time 
Multitasking is less productive than focusing on a single task at a time. Researchers from Stanford University found that “People who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.” Stay focused on one thing at a time. You’ll absorb more information and complete assignments with greater productivity and ease than if you were trying to do many things at once.  

### Take breaks 
Resting your brain after learning is critical to high performance. If you find yourself working on a challenging problem without much progress for an hour, take a break. Walking outside, taking a shower or talking with a friend can help you to re-energize and even give you new ideas on how to tackle the project. 

### Your learning journey starts now!  
While preparing for the module quiz or working on achieving your learning goals you're encouraged to:   
- Work through each lesson in the learning pathway. Try not to skip any activities or lessons unless you are certain that you already know this information well enough to move ahead.    
- Take the opportunity to go back and watch a video or read all the information provided before moving on to the next lesson or module.  
- Complete all the knowledge and module quizzes and exercises.
- Read the feedback carefully when answering quizzes, as this will help you to reinforce what you are learning.  
- Make use of the practical learning environment provided by the exercises. You can gain substantial reinforcement of your learning through the step-by-step application of your skills.





## How to Position Yourself for a New Career
You are well on your way to becoming a software developer.

You took the most important first step: you started.

While this specialization on Coursera will make you into a well-rounded junior developer, you are basically just getting started.

Here are some proven tips to make the transition to your new career as smooth as possible.



### Be persistent
Succeeding in your career efforts is not easy. Luckily, it's not too hard either. Consider this new endeavor of learning to code a part of your everyday life.

Make it as much of a routine as possible. Hopefully, it will work like this: 
- You wake up, 
- You brush your teeth, 
- You run some errands, 
- And then you write and learn to code.

Obviously, there are things like your school obligations, or your day job, or other places you need to be and things you need to do.

However, if you don't code regularly - preferably on a daily basis - your progress will be slower. Try to set aside some time to consistently code and learn every day. Persistence is key.



### Start building simple apps today
Don't wait until you "learn enough". There's always more to learn, and it's best to get started with any kind of a simple project right now.

Even just taking the code from this specialization and tinkering with it will do wonders for your confidence and the speed at which you acquire new knowledge.

Also, the more you practice, the better you'll retain what you've learned.

Having your own projects that you can showcase to others - no matter how small or straightforward shows a track record and dedication. This is something that your future employer might be impressed with, so start today.



### Set up a GitHub account
Since we're on the topic of personal projects, head on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and set up your developer profile right away. It's essential to have an account there since you can keep all your projects in a single location that you can access from any computer.

You can almost think of your GitHub account as an additional brain power. No matter how long ago, whatever you've worked on will remain there, waiting for you to peek into and re-familiarise yourself with.



### Pair program
Try to find someone at your level or perhaps slightly more knowledgeable than you and ask them to set up a recurring pair programming session.

This works nicely because having a pair programming partner can speed up your learning. You also have someone to be accountable to.



### Start a coding blog
Technical communication is important for developers, and just like anything else, you get better with practice.

Starting a coding blog will work the same as having a GitHub account, with some the additional benefits: 
- It shows even more dedication - and this increases your chances of getting hired 
- It helps you experiment with different technologies 
- Setting up your own website is practical learning in its own right and one more project to add to your CV



### Collaborate on open source projects
Even if you are just starting out and are really struggling to get into this field, you can still be a valuable contributor to open-source projects. 

There are so many open-source projects that are in demand for all kinds of contributors. 

Even contributing to a project by fixing some typos in documentation files is a nice start to getting more involved and putting yourself out there.



### Get a certificate
Getting certified is always a good thing. The fact that you're reading this lesson right now confirms that you're on your way to receiving a certificate of completion from Coursera!



### Keep a positive attitude
As with anything worth doing, you might sometimes get tired, not understanding how something works, and perhaps even feel like giving up.

Remember to stay consistent.

There are always ups and downs in life, but sometimes it's worth it to think of all the things you've achieved so far and use that as motivation to keep at it.



### Never stop learning
There's **always more to learn in IT**, and that's probably the best thing about it. It's the very thing that makes it fun and provides an opportunity for each developer to get ahead in their career.





## How to uncover job opportunities
Learning how to program in ```JavaScript``` helps you prepare for a wide range of job opportunities. This is in part because it expands the possibilities of what you can build as a developer. 

JavaScript is one of the most in-demand programming languages, as it is used in nearly all active websites. Its versatility enables developers to use popular libraries, plugins, and frameworks such as React, which improves efficiency and productivity.

With all flexibility that programming in JavaScript brings, it is no surprise that there are different careers that you might want to follow. However, no matter what career path you choose, you will always want to learn other technologies like HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, or Python, so you are more marketable. 

Let’s cover a few of the most common roles you can get if you know how to program in JavaScript. 



### Mobile Developer
There has been a constant increase in the demand for mobile developers as mobile devices’ use for accessing the internet has been on the rise. Mobile developers specialize in building apps for platforms like Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS. Many developers choose to use React Native, which allows them to build one application using JavaScript that works on both Android and iOS devices. Mobile developers work with UX and UI designers and use React’s UI capabilities to implement functionalities that customers will use. Mobile developers also make sure that the front-end and the back-end of the applications work seamlessly. Other skills that mobile developers may have include HTML, CSS, Java, Kotlin, Objective-C, C++, C#, among others. 



### Front-End Developer 
As the name implies, front-end developers build the user-facing parts of websites and apps. They work closely with designers to implement visual and interactive elements through coding, using HTML, CSS, and of course, JavaScript. They also use libraries and frameworks like React to save time and make their work more efficient. Front-end developers may also be responsible for making sure the final user has a good user experience and that websites and apps behave as expected and are free of errors and bugs. 



### Back-End Developer 
Back-end developers work on the back-end of websites and applications. They can use JavaScript with Node.js to develop back-end functionalities. Among these functionalities are streaming and chat-based applications, as well as JSON APIs and serverless functions. Back-end developers possess additional skills, including professional working knowledge of Python, APIs, cloud infrastructure, and database. 



### Full-Stack Developer 
As you might guess, a full-stack developer works with both the front- and back-end of building websites and apps. So, these professionals combine the skills in these two areas. They can use frameworks like React to work on the front-end and Node.js to work on the back-end. They also apply skills in addition to JavaScript to build websites and apps.



### Your professional journey ahead
As you embark on the exciting career as a professional developer, you will realize that you will progressively expand your skills to include a wide range of technologies and programming languages besides JavaScript.

If you want to have an idea of the opportunities available in these areas, you might want to check your favorite job search website or app and look for jobs related to JavaScript. You will learn that there is no shortage of opportunities. And as you start reading more about these roles, you will find that JavaScript is often only one of the competencies that employers are looking for. 

But don’t worry, as you advance in your studies and in your career, you will further develop your skills to focus on the professional path you want to follow. 

Good luck on your professional journey!
