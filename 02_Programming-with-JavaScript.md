## How to be successful in this course
Taking an online course can be overwhelming. How do you learn at your own pace and successfully achieve your goals? 

Here are some general tips that can help you stay focused and on track.



### Set daily goals for studying 
Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish in your course each day. Setting a clear goal can help you stay motivated and beat procrastination. The goal should be specific and easy to measure, such as "I’ll watch all the videos in Module 2 and complete the first programming assignment". And don’t forget to reward yourself when you make progress towards your goal! 



### Create a dedicated study space 
It’s easier to recall information if you’re in the same place where you first learned it, so having a dedicated space at home to take online courses can make your learning more effective. Remove any distractions from the space and if possible, make it separate from your bed or sofa. A clear distinction between where you study and where you take breaks can help you focus.  



### Schedule time to study on your calendar 
Open your calendar and choose a predictable, reliable time that you can dedicate to watching lectures and completing assignments. This helps ensure that your courses won’t become the last thing on your to-do list. 

_**Tip:** You can add deadlines for a Coursera course to your Google calendar, Apple calendar, or another calendar app._



### Keep yourself accountable 
Tell your friends about the courses you’re taking, post achievements to your social media accounts or blog about your homework assignments. Having a community and support network of friends and family to cheer you on makes a difference!



### Actively take notes 
Taking notes can promote active thinking, boost comprehension and extend your attention span. It’s a good strategy to internalize knowledge whether you’re learning online or in the classroom. So, grab a notebook or find a digital app that works best for you and start synthesizing key points. 

_**Tip:** While watching a lecture on Coursera, you can click the 'Save Note' button below the video to save a screenshot to your course notes and add your own comments._



### Join the discussion 
Course discussion forums are a great place to ask questions about assignments, discuss topics, share resources and make friends. Our research shows that learners who participate in the discussion forums are 37% more likely to complete a course. So make a post today! 



### Do one thing at a time 
Multitasking is less productive than focusing on a single task at a time. Researchers from Stanford University found that “People who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.” Stay focused on one thing at a time. You’ll absorb more information and complete assignments with greater productivity and ease than if you were trying to do many things at once.  



### Take breaks 
Resting your brain after learning is critical to high performance. If you find yourself working on a challenging problem without much progress for an hour, take a break. Walking outside, taking a shower or talking with a friend can help you to re-energize and even give you new ideas on how to tackle the project. 



### Your learning journey starts now!  
While preparing for the module quiz or working on achieving your learning goals you're encouraged to:   
- Work through each lesson in the learning pathway. Try not to skip any activities or lessons unless you are certain that you already know this information well enough to move ahead.    
- Take the opportunity to go back and watch a video or read all the information provided before moving on to the next lesson or module.  
- Complete all the knowledge and module quizzes and exercises.
- Read the feedback carefully when answering quizzes, as this will help you to reinforce what you are learning.  
- Make use of the practical learning environment provided by the exercises. You can gain substantial reinforcement of your learning through the step-by-step application of your skills.





## How to Position Yourself for a New Career
You are well on your way to becoming a software developer.

You took the most important first step: you started.

While this specialization on Coursera will make you into a well-rounded junior developer, you are basically just getting started.

Here are some proven tips to make the transition to your new career as smooth as possible.



### Be persistent
Succeeding in your career efforts is not easy. Luckily, it's not too hard either. Consider this new endeavor of learning to code a part of your everyday life.

Make it as much of a routine as possible. Hopefully, it will work like this: 
- You wake up, 
- You brush your teeth, 
- You run some errands, 
- And then you write and learn to code.

Obviously, there are things like your school obligations, or your day job, or other places you need to be and things you need to do.

However, if you don't code regularly - preferably on a daily basis - your progress will be slower. Try to set aside some time to consistently code and learn every day. Persistence is key.



### Start building simple apps today
Don't wait until you "learn enough". There's always more to learn, and it's best to get started with any kind of a simple project right now.

Even just taking the code from this specialization and tinkering with it will do wonders for your confidence and the speed at which you acquire new knowledge.

Also, the more you practice, the better you'll retain what you've learned.

Having your own projects that you can showcase to others - no matter how small or straightforward shows a track record and dedication. This is something that your future employer might be impressed with, so start today.



### Set up a GitHub account
Since we're on the topic of personal projects, head on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and set up your developer profile right away. It's essential to have an account there since you can keep all your projects in a single location that you can access from any computer.

You can almost think of your GitHub account as an additional brain power. No matter how long ago, whatever you've worked on will remain there, waiting for you to peek into and re-familiarise yourself with.



### Pair program
Try to find someone at your level or perhaps slightly more knowledgeable than you and ask them to set up a recurring pair programming session.

This works nicely because having a pair programming partner can speed up your learning. You also have someone to be accountable to.



### Start a coding blog
Technical communication is important for developers, and just like anything else, you get better with practice.

Starting a coding blog will work the same as having a GitHub account, with some the additional benefits: 
- It shows even more dedication - and this increases your chances of getting hired 
- It helps you experiment with different technologies 
- Setting up your own website is practical learning in its own right and one more project to add to your CV



### Collaborate on open source projects
Even if you are just starting out and are really struggling to get into this field, you can still be a valuable contributor to open-source projects. 

There are so many open-source projects that are in demand for all kinds of contributors. 

Even contributing to a project by fixing some typos in documentation files is a nice start to getting more involved and putting yourself out there.



### Get a certificate
Getting certified is always a good thing. The fact that you're reading this lesson right now confirms that you're on your way to receiving a certificate of completion from Coursera!



### Keep a positive attitude
As with anything worth doing, you might sometimes get tired, not understanding how something works, and perhaps even feel like giving up.

Remember to stay consistent.

There are always ups and downs in life, but sometimes it's worth it to think of all the things you've achieved so far and use that as motivation to keep at it.



### Never stop learning
There's **always more to learn in IT**, and that's probably the best thing about it. It's the very thing that makes it fun and provides an opportunity for each developer to get ahead in their career.





## How to uncover job opportunities
Learning how to program in ```JavaScript``` helps you prepare for a wide range of job opportunities. This is in part because it expands the possibilities of what you can build as a developer. 

JavaScript is one of the most in-demand programming languages, as it is used in nearly all active websites. Its versatility enables developers to use popular libraries, plugins, and frameworks such as React, which improves efficiency and productivity.

With all flexibility that programming in JavaScript brings, it is no surprise that there are different careers that you might want to follow. However, no matter what career path you choose, you will always want to learn other technologies like HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, or Python, so you are more marketable. 

Let’s cover a few of the most common roles you can get if you know how to program in JavaScript. 



### Mobile Developer
There has been a constant increase in the demand for mobile developers as mobile devices’ use for accessing the internet has been on the rise. Mobile developers specialize in building apps for platforms like Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS. Many developers choose to use React Native, which allows them to build one application using JavaScript that works on both Android and iOS devices. Mobile developers work with UX and UI designers and use React’s UI capabilities to implement functionalities that customers will use. Mobile developers also make sure that the front-end and the back-end of the applications work seamlessly. Other skills that mobile developers may have include HTML, CSS, Java, Kotlin, Objective-C, C++, C#, among others. 



### Front-End Developer 
As the name implies, front-end developers build the user-facing parts of websites and apps. They work closely with designers to implement visual and interactive elements through coding, using HTML, CSS, and of course, JavaScript. They also use libraries and frameworks like React to save time and make their work more efficient. Front-end developers may also be responsible for making sure the final user has a good user experience and that websites and apps behave as expected and are free of errors and bugs. 



### Back-End Developer 
Back-end developers work on the back-end of websites and applications. They can use JavaScript with Node.js to develop back-end functionalities. Among these functionalities are streaming and chat-based applications, as well as JSON APIs and serverless functions. Back-end developers possess additional skills, including professional working knowledge of Python, APIs, cloud infrastructure, and database. 



### Full-Stack Developer 
As you might guess, a full-stack developer works with both the front- and back-end of building websites and apps. So, these professionals combine the skills in these two areas. They can use frameworks like React to work on the front-end and Node.js to work on the back-end. They also apply skills in addition to JavaScript to build websites and apps.



### Your professional journey ahead
As you embark on the exciting career as a professional developer, you will realize that you will progressively expand your skills to include a wide range of technologies and programming languages besides JavaScript.

If you want to have an idea of the opportunities available in these areas, you might want to check your favorite job search website or app and look for jobs related to JavaScript. You will learn that there is no shortage of opportunities. And as you start reading more about these roles, you will find that JavaScript is often only one of the competencies that employers are looking for. 

But don’t worry, as you advance in your studies and in your career, you will further develop your skills to focus on the professional path you want to follow. 

Good luck on your professional journey!

# Module 01 - Introduction to JavaScript



## Writing your first Javascript code
In this reading, you'll learn about comments in JavaScript. Additionally, you'll learn about the ```semi-colon ;``` in JavaScript: what it does and why it is used. You will then download a browser if you don't have one installed and run your first piece of JavaScript using the Console.



### Comments in JavaScript
I've chosen comments as the starting point for two reasons: 
1. Their syntax - the way comments are written is easy to understand. 
2. Writing comments can empower you as a developer.

First, I'll explain the syntax, and after that, I'll discuss why being able to write comments is so empowering.


#### Comments in JavaScript: the syntax
There are two varieties of comments in JavaScript: 
1. Single-line comments 
2. Multi-line comments

A single-line comment is created when you add two forward-slash characters one after the other, without spaces. 

```js
// this is a comment!
```

Anything that follows a single-line comment in JavaScript is ignored by the browser.

This means that, essentially, you can write any kind of text, code, characters, emojis, whatever - and the browser will ignore it.

A multi-line comment, as its name says, spans for several lines of code and is created with a forward slash and a star. For example: 

```js
/*
this
is
a
multi-line
comment
*/
```

You can also use the multi-line comment syntax on a single line of code, as follows: 

```js
/* this is a multi-line comment on a single line */
```



### Why writing comments is empowering
In this course, it is assumed that you've never written a single line of JavaScript code.

With this assumption in mind, consider the effects of what you've just learned, that is, the effects of learning how to write comments in JavaScript: 
1. You can now freely express your ideas about any code that you write. 
2. You can add comments to any code that already exists.
3. Those comments can be intended for your future self, or for colleagues on your development team.

So, comments are empowering because they facilitate communication with your future self or with your team members, allowing you to ask questions about the code, mark the code as "to do", or as "to improve", or just simply explain what a given piece of code does. 

Additionally, you can even comment out some working code in a JavaScript file - to prevent it from running.

Effectively, comments allow you to "switch off" pieces of JavaScript code.

There can be many reasons for that: 
1. Trying to understand how a given piece of code works.
2. Testing different solutions to a coding problem - while not having to delete existing code.
3. Debugging - trying to pin-point why your code is broken or behaving unpredictably.



### The semi-colon in JavaScript
In the English language, the fullstop or period - the . character - is used to separate thoughts into sentences.

By clearly separating thoughts with the fullstop, you avoid being misunderstood.

In JavaScript, the semi-colon - the ```;``` character - has a similar purpose: it is used to clearly delimit parts of the code from some other parts of the code.


#### Automatic Semi-Colon Insertion (ASI)
Interestingly, the browser has a feature known as "Automatic Semi-colon Insertion" - meaning, it does a pretty good job of "filling in the blanks" in case there is a missing semi-colon where there should be one.

Effectively, what that means for developers is that most of the time, it makes no difference if a semi-colon is added or not, since the browser is likely to figure it out anyway.

That's why some developers say that you shouldn't bother with adding semi-colons at all.

However, other developers argue that it's better to use it wherever it's needed - for the sake of clarity.

The truth is that most of the time, you can think of adding semi-colons in JavaScript as optional - and somewhat of a stylistic preference.


#### A note on using the console in the developer tools in your browser
As already mentioned earlier on in this course, one of the reasons why JavaScript is so popular is because it's so approachable.

To get started with JavaScript, all you need is a browser. In this course I'll be using Google Chrome.

Once you've installed the browser and run it, right-click on the currently active web page and click the Inspect command on the right-click contextual menu.

This will open the Developer Tools and then you can click on the Console tab to open the console, or alternatively, pressing the ESC key will toggle on and off the console regardless of the currently active Developer Tools panel.

You can type any JavaScript command you like into the DevTools console.


#### If you need to type multiple lines of code before you run them, make sure to press the SHIFT + ENTER shortcut key to get onto the next line.
Notice the distinction between pressing the ENTER key to run the JavaScript code you've typed, versus pressing the SHIFT + ENTER shortcut to move onto the next line of code (rather than running the code you've already typed up).

This is all that you need to get started writing JavaScript code!

In the upcoming lessons, feel free to follow along in either of two ways: 

Using the VS Code editor and the Code Runner extension as previously described 

Using the Chrome browser itself, and running the code inside the DevTools console as described in this reading



### Output a greeting into the console
Now that you know how to get to the Developer Tools' Console tab, let's now use it to run your first piece of real JavaScript code.

In Chrome, with the Developer Tools open, click into the empty space in the console tab, just to the right of the blue > character. You should see a blinking vertical line (also referred to as "the cursor"). The cursor indicates that you can type into the console.

If you type valid JavaScript code, it will be executed, meaning: it will be processed and it might result in some kind of output.

You'll now use the console.log function to output the words "Hello, World".

To do so, type the following command into the console: 

```js
console.log("Hello, World");
```

![Google Chrome DevTools open with the Console tab in focus, showing the command of console.log("Hello, World")][img020101]

If you've done everything as instructed, the words "Hello, World" should be output in the console.

Here's another, more complex command, to show you that the console.log command comes with a number of tricks.

For example, did you know that you can style the output in the console?

In this code snippet, there are a few additions: the font size is different and the color is blue: 

```js
console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px");
```

![console log with percentage c authors console log with percentage c authors][img020102]

If you copy-paste this piece of code, or perhaps, simply type it into the console, once you press the ```ENTER``` key to run it, you'll get the words "Hello, World" output to the console. This time, however, the color of the letters will be blue, and the font size will be 40px. So, you've just learned a nice trick with the console. 

If you add the %c right after the " character, you can then style the console output by adding the , character after the second ", and then, inside another pair of " and " characters, use valid CSS code to style the words you want to output in the console.

The reason for showing you this little trick was to hopefully get you motivated to practice writing various words into the console.log command, and to use your CSS skills to change the styling of these words in the console output. That way, you might find it fun to practice this newly acquired skill - and learning and fun always go nicely together.



### Output multiple words into the console
To output multiple words into the console, you can join them using the + character, formally known as the "concatenation operator" when we're joining pieces of text, or the "addition operator", for performing the mathematical operation of adding two numbers. 

Here is an example of joining three separate pieces of text: ```console.log("Hello " + "there, " + "World")```. The output of this command will be: Hello there, World.

Here is an example of outputting three separate pieces of text using the , character instead:

```console.log("Hello", "there,", "World")```

The output of this command will still be: Hello there, World.

**Note:** You may observe slight variations in the spacing between words due to default browser settings. 

Using ```,``` in console.log does not combine the arguments into a single string but outputs them as separate values, automatically adding a space between them. This behavior contrasts with +, which concatenates all pieces into a single string without adding spaces unless explicitly included.





## Exercise: Declaring variables
In this exercise, you will practice declaring variables.

To check the output of your code, please enter it into the text box provided and click the "Run" button. This will execute the code and display the resulting output.

### Tasks
1. Declare a new variable named petDog and give it the name Rex.
2. Declare a new variable named petCat and give it the name Pepper.
3. Log the petDog variable to the console.
4. Log the  petCat variable to the console.
5. Log the following to the console: the text "My pet dog's name is: " and the petDog variable.
6. Log the following to the console: the text "My pet cat's name is: " and the petCat variable.
7. Declare another variable and name it catSound. Assign the string of "purr" to it.
8. Declare another variable and name it dogSound. Assign the string of "woof" to it.
9. Log the following to the console: the variable petDog, then the string "says", then the variable dogSound.
10. Log the following to the console: the variable petCat, then the string "says", then the variable catSound.
11. Reassign the value stored in catSound to the string "meow".
12. Log the following to the console: the variable petCat, then the string "now says", then the variable catSound.

Make sure to output all your variables. Feel free to play.
```js
//Declare a new variable named petDog and give it the name Rex.
var petDog = "Rex";
//Declare a new variable named petCat and give it the name Pepper.
var petCat = "Pepper";
//Log the petDog variable to the console.
console.log(petDog);
//Log the  petCat variable to the console.
console.log(petCat);
//Log the following to the console: the text "My pet dog's name is: " and the petDog variable.
console.log("My pet dog's name is: " + petDog);
//Log the following to the console: the text "My pet cat's name is: " and the petCat variable.
console.log("My pet cat's name is: " + petCat);
//Declare another variable and name it catSound. Assign the string of "purr" to it.
var catSound = "purr";
//Declare another variable and name it dogSound. Assign the string of "woof" to it.
var dogSound = "woof";
//Log the following to the console: the variable petDog, then the string "says", then the variable dogSound.
console.log(petDog,"says",dogSound);
//Log the following to the console: the variable petCat, then the string "says", then the variable catSound.
console.log(petCat,"says",catSound);
//Reassign the value stored in catSound to the string "meow".
catSound = "meow";
//Log the following to the console: the variable petCat, then the string "now says", then the variable catSound.
console.log(petCat,"now says",catSound);
```





## Operators in depth
In this reading, you will learn about additional operators, operator precedence and operator associativity. I'll also provide you with some examples of logical operators.

### 1. Additional operators
- Logical AND operator: ```&&``` 
- Logical OR operator: ```||``` 
- Logical NOT operator: ```!``` 
- The modulus operator: ```%``` 
- The equality operator: ```==```
- The strict equality operator: ```===```
- The inequality operator: ```!=```
- The strict inequality operator: ```!==```
- The addition assignment operator: ```+=``` 
- The concatenation assignment operator: ```+=``` (it's the same as the previous one - more on that later)

#### The logical AND operator in JavaScript: &&
The **logical AND operator** is, for example, used to confirm if multiple comparisons will return true.

In JavaScript, this operator consists of two ampersand symbols together: ```&&```.

Let's say you're tasked with coming up with some code that will check if the ```currentTime``` variable is between ```9 a.m.``` and ```5 p.m.``` The code needs to ```console.log true``` if ```currentTime > 9``` and if ```currentTime < 17```.

Here's a solution: 
```js
var currentTime = 10;
console.log(currentTime > 9 && currentTime < 17);
```

How does this code work?

First, on line one, I set the ```currentTime``` variable, and assign the value of ```10``` to it.

Next, on line two I console log two comparisons: 
```currentTime > 9```
```currentTime < 17```

I also use the ```&&```  logical operator to join the two comparisons.

Effectively, my code is interpreted as the following:
```js
console.log(10 > 9 && 10 < 17);
```

The comparison of ```10 > 9``` will return ```true``.

Also, the comparison of ````10 < 17``` will return true.

This means I can further re-write line two of my solution as follows: 
```js
console.log(true && true);
```

In essence, this is how my code works.

Now, the question is, what will be the result of ```console.log(true && true)```?

To understand the answer, you need to know the behavior of the ```&&``` logical operator.

The ```&&``` logical operator returns a single value: the boolean ```true``` or ```false```, based on the following rules: 
- It returns ```true``` if both the values on its right and on its left are evaluated to ```true``` 
- It returns ```false``` in all the other instances

In other words: 

```console.log(true && true)``` will output: ```true``` 

```console.log(true && false)``` will output: ```false```

```console.log(false && true)``` will output: ```false```

```console.log(false && false)``` will output: ```false```


#### The logical OR operator in JavaScript: ||
The logical ```OR``` operator in JavaScript consists of two pipe symbols together: ```||```.

It is used when you want to check if at least one of the given comparisons evaluates to ```true```.

Consider the following task: You need to write a program in JavaScript which will return ```true``` if the value of the ```currentTime``` variable is not between ```9``` and ```17```. Put differently, your code needs to console.log ```true``` if the value of the variable currentTime is either less than ```9``` or greater than ```17```.

Here's a solution: 
```js
var currentTime = 7;
console.log(currentTime < 9 || currentTime > 17);
```

In line one of the code I assign the number ```7``` to the variable currentTime.

On line ```two```, I console log the result of checking if either ```currentTime < 9``` or ```currentTime > 17``` will evaluate to ```true```.

It's the same as this: 

```js
var currentTime = 7;
console.log(true || false);
```

Here are the rules of how the ```||``` operator evaluates given values: 

```console.log(true || true)``` will output: ```true``` 

```console.log(true || false)``` will output: ```true``` 

```console.log(false || true)``` will output: ```true``` 

```console.log(false || false)``` will output: ```false```

The logical OR operator will always return ```true```, except when both sides evaluate to ```false```. In other words, for the logical OR operator to return false, the results of both comparisons must return false.

Going back to the example of checking if either ```currentTime < 9``` or ```currentTime > 17```, this makes sense: the only time you will get ```false``` is when the value stored in the currentTime variable is greater than ```9``` and less than ```17```.


#### The logical NOT operator: !
In JavaScript, the symbol for the logical NOT operator is the exclamation mark: !.

You can think of the ! operator as a switch, which flips the evaluated boolean value from true to false and from false to true.

For example, if I assign the boolean value of true to the petHungry variable: 

var petHungry = true;

...then I can console log the fact that the pet is no longer hungry by using the ! operator to flip the boolean value stored inside of the petHungry variable, like so:

console.log('Feeding the pet');
console.log("Pet is hungry: ", !petHungry);
console.log(petHungry);

This is the output of the above code:   

1234

Feeding the pet
Pet is hungry: false
true
In the provided code, console.log("Pet is hungry: ", !petHungry); will show false for the negated value, but the actual value of petHungry remains true unless reassigned.

Notice, however, that the code on last line of the example above still outputs true - that's due to the fact that I didn't reassign the value of the petHungry variable.

Here's how I could permanently change the value stored in the petHungry variable from true to false: 

2
var petHungry = true;
petHungry = !petHungry;
In this example, I first assign the value of true to the new variable of petHungry. Then, I reassign the opposite value (!true, or 'not true') to the petHungry variable.

The modulus operator: %
The modulus operator is another mathematical operator in JavaScript. It returns the remainder of division.

To demonstrate how it works, imagine that a small restaurant has a total of 5 tables, and each table can seat 4 guests. The restaurant suddenly receives 22 guests.

How many guests will not be able to sit down in the restaurant?

You can use the modulus operator to solve this.

1
console.log(22 % 5); // 2
The output is 2, because when I divide 22 by 5, I get a 4, and the remainder is 2. So there are 2 people who couldn't get a place in this restaurant.

The equality operator, ==
The equality operator checks if two values are equal.

For example, this comparison returns true: 5 == 5. Indeed, it is true that 5 is equal to 5.

Here's an example of the equality operator returning false:  5 == 6. Indeed, it is true that 5 is not equal to 6.

Additionally, even if one of the compared values is of the number type, and the other is of the string type, the returned value is still true: 5 == "5". 

This means that the equality operator compares only the values, but not the types.

The strict equality operator, ===
The strict equality operator compares for both the values and the data types.

With the strict equality operator, comparing 5 === 5 still returns true. The values on each side of the strict equality operator have the same value and the same type. However, comparing 5 === "5" now returns false, because the values are equal, but the data type is different.

The inequality operator, !=
The inequality operator checks if two values are not the same, but it does not check against the difference in types.

For example, 5 != "5" returns false, because it's false to claim that the number 5 is not equal to number 5, even though this other number is of the string data type.

The strict inequality operator !==
For the strict inequality operator to return false, the compared values have to have the same value and the same data type. 

For example,  5 !== 5 returns false because it is false to say that the number 5 is not of the same value and data type as another number 5.

However, comparing the number 5 and the string 5, using the strict inequality operator, returns true.

1
console.log(5 !== "5")

2. Using the + operators on strings and numbers
Combining two strings using the + operator
The + operator, when used with number data type, adds those values together.

However, the + operator is also used to join string data type together.

For example:

12
"inter" + "net" // "internet"
"note" + "book" // "notebook"
If the + operator is used to join strings, then it is referred to as the concatenation operator, and you'll say that it's used to concatenate strings.

When used with numbers, the + operator is the addition operator, and when used with strings, the + operator is the concatenation operator.

Combining strings and numbers using the + operator
But what happens when one combines a string and a number using the + operator?

Here's an example:

123
365 + " days" // "365 days"
12 + " months" // "12 months"

Here, JavaScript tries to help by converting the numbers to strings, and then concatenating the number and the string together, ending up with a string value.

The process of this "under-the-hood" conversion of values in JavaScript is referred to as "coercion". JavaScript coerces a number value to a string value - so that it can run the + operator on disparate data types.

The process of coercion can sometimes be a bit unexpected.

Consider the following example:

1
1 + "2"
What will be the result of 1 + "2"?

Note that the value of 1 is of the number data type, and the value of "2" is of the string data type.  JavaScript will coerce the number 1 to a string of "1", and then concatenate it with the string of "2".  The result is a string of "12".

The addition assignment operator, +=
The addition assignment operator is used when one wants to accumulate the values stored in a variable.

Here's an example: You are counting the number of overtime hours worked in a week.

You don't have to specify the type of work, you just want to count total hours.

You might code a program to track it, like this:

123456
var mon = 1;
var tue = 2;
var wed = 1;
var thu = 2;
var fri = 3;
console.log(mon + tue + wed + thu + fri); // 9
You can simplify the above code by using the addition assignment operator, as follows:

123456
var overtime = 1;
overtime += 2;
overtime += 1;
overtime += 2;
overtime += 3;
console.log(overtime); // 9
Using the addition assignment operator reduces the lines of your code.

The concatenation assignment operator, +=
This operator's syntax is exactly the same as the addition assignment operator. The difference is in the data type used:

1234567
var longString = "";
longString += "Once";
longString += " upon";
longString += " a";
longString += " time";
longString += "...";
console.log(longString); // "Once upon a time..."
Operator precedence and associativity
Operator precedence is a set of rules that determines which operator should be evaluated first.

Consider the following example:

1
1 * 2 + 3
The result of the above code is 5, because the multiplication operator has precedence over the addition operator.

Operator associativity determines how the precedence works when the code uses operators with the same precedence.

There are two kinds: 

left-to-right associativity

right-to-left associativity

For example, the assignment operator is right-to-left associative, while the greater than operator is left-to-right associative:

12
var num = 10; // the value on the right is assigned to the variable name on the left
5 > 4 > 3; // the 5 > 4 is evaluated first (to `true`), then true > 3 is evaluated to `false`, because the `true` value is coerced to `1`
Conclusion
In this reading, we explored the fundamental and advanced aspects of JavaScript operators, including their types, precedence, and associativity. A deeper understanding of operator precedence clarified how JavaScript determines the order of evaluation, while operator associativity explained the behavior of operators with the same precedence level. Through practical examples, we demonstrated the importance of knowing how different operators behave, especially when combining numbers, strings, and boolean values.

Mastering JavaScript operators enables developers to write concise, efficient, and effective code. With this foundation, you are better equipped to navigate complex logical and mathematical scenarios in your programs, making your JavaScript skills more robust and versatile.
